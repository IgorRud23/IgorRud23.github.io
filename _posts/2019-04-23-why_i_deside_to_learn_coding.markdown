Why the developer? If you will ask me a question like this my answer will be simple. Yes, this is as simple as you may think. My main motivation to become a developer is the prospect of financial and career opportunities. In the modern world, everyone's goal to be successful and financially independent. To live a good life, to help your parents, to be able to afford to live in a big city,  to be able to travel, to be able to get everything you desire you need money. Money is the thing that makes us wake up early in the morning and come home tired after a day at work, money motivates us to study to get a better job, to be able to succeed in our careers, money make your smile brighter and your mama proud. I guess this is too much about my motivation.

To learn a programming language was always something I desired but way outside of my reach, I was thinking about how many ideas I have to build an app that would help people this, I would build a website that would sell that but I was always afraid to start.  Now, almost three months into the program I see that I can, I see that I will, I see interesting stuff that I want to be my career. I know that my programming skills will lead not only to the job which gives you money, but it also can grow in something bigger. I see so much potential.

I believe that by becoming a guru in programming, I will be able to create a lot of interesting and helpful programs and websites. I know I can bring so many new, cool things to the world, I wish I could show you what is in my head. Things that can help society, things that can help other people to touch new horizons of a digital world. I feel so delighted to grow my inner personality through the acquiring of a new skill. 

Some people are unhappy with their lives, unhappy with their careers. People tend to procrastinate, tend to make excuses, people who fail cannot see the forest through the trees. I believe, with a good amount of motivation and hard work everyone can be successful. I know that next year I will work at Google or at a small startup company that we will bring public, as I always finish what I started and I believe in success and positive vibes.
