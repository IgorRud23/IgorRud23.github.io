Before we explore some features of React let's get into some history of it, where it's come from and who created it, as long as all of us future coders it's should be interesting. So React was created by Jordan Walke in 2011, he was a Facebook software engineer at that moment when he decides to create this library. The first use case of React was in Facebook’s newsfeed in 2011. Later on, it is picked up by Instagram to use it in their system. With time, React grew, and Facebook decided to make it open source in May 2013 at JSConf US.

So what is React? React is an open-source JavaScript library that performs data viewing with the help of HTML. React uses a virtual tree reconciliation method to react to changes in input data. Whenever any data changes, instead of rebuilding the whole DOM tree (which would be slow) — it decides what changed in its virtual DOM and then makes the smallest number of DOM changes necessary. The virtual tree is in contrast to something like vanilla JS or jQuery where you are setting/updating DOM nodes directly. With React, you can create reusable components that will always render the same data in the same way. 

For example, you are a football fan and you build a React website for tracking scores. Users who visit your site won’t need to wait for the entire tree to deconstruct and reconstruct when the newest data on the half-pipe is available. React components will efficiently update to accommodate the changing data.
React is definitely a helpful library and it's making our life like a software engineers mutch easier and believe me, you want to know it and use it. To dive deep in to React there is a countless online source of information on the internet or if you more old-school and prefer books here is some of them for beginners to look up to: 
* Learning React Native: Building Native Mobile Apps with JavaScript by Bonnie Eisenman   
* SurviveJS - Webpack and React: From apprentice to master by Juho Vepsäläinen
* ReactJS Cookbook by Johannes Stein
