As per school requirements, the task has to be scraped from the site, any website from the internet, and a program must be created to execute information from that webpage. I tried to build a very simple program but in the end, I realized that even the simplest program may take some time to create.   

My suggestion to you, in order to avoid any problem please read all required material, learn deeper and practice as much as you can. Scraping is a separate part in coding, it is not easy to do, you need to pay attention to details otherwise you may encounter unexpected issues and your productive time will be wasted.  

I scraped a very popular website, I advise you to visit it when you are bored. While I was scraping website information I stumbled over a problem, the text was returned with a bunch of empty spaces and other characters I did not need. Apparently, I have stocked on an iteration problem, but then I figured out that I can avoid this problem by fixing a return text with “Regex”.  Regex is a very important coding unit that I overlooked but now after I rediscovered it, I figure out that this is a very helpful part of coding. So my strong suggestion to you, pay more attention to seemingly small units such as Regex. It will help you to build a proper program without wasting too much time on it. Last but not least, please complete all the school's requirements and review other material, don’t leave it for the last moment. Better do it right away, and prepare for the next project. Never stop, hard work leads to success.
