Hello team. This is my first Sinatra project and it was challenging, to say the least. The main goal was to make a project where user can simply sing up and then log in to his/her account. Once user entered the app, user should be able to write, edit or delete his/her own reviews and comments. User can make changes to everything he/she wants within the application.
I have used Corneal for this project in particular. For your information, Corneal is an app generator with Rails-like simplicity, this generator will help user to build a skeleton of all directories that are unique for this project. Corneal is a tool that will make your life much easier.
If you will learn MVC (Model, View, Controller) before this project, you will acquire enough knowledge to make your project much fester. In addition, it is really important to understand MVC kitchen. 
So, basically, I made my app and called it “FestivalReview App” and according to the name, you've guessed it, my application is built for the Music Festival Reviews where people can share their experiences about one or another festival.
Finally, the most important what I wanted to tell you guys, work hard every day and you will achieve your goals.
