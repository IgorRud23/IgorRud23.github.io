Hello guys. A couple of days ago I  finally finished my project, the last rails project was definitely challenging for me; however,  I did overcome the challenge and here I am proudly submitting my project. As may be many of you, I also had some problems with “omniauth” gem, we use that for login to social media. I did not realize at first but the problem was because of my misspelling, so please pay attention to the text while you writing your code. But you know,  we learning on our mistakes. I figured out, that I learned more from debugging my project, than from a class material, some times. So don’t worry if something goes wrong in your code and your app crashes, that means you are on the right way, you just need to dig a little bit dipper. Read error messages what’s comes out, figure out in which part of code is mulfunctioning, google how to fix it. If you don’t cannot find a solution, then try to think it again why it doesn't work, try to picture a process and you'll succeed. Don’t be shy to connect trough zoom with your group members, it will help you a lot. And yes guys, learn how to use console and use it for checking what is going on in your code, that’s really the key to success.
